# eune.op.gg-clone
Build a website with Bootstrap4. This website looks as if it is built entirely with Bootstrap. Let's see if I can recreate it.

# The reason to build this clone
 - I finished a Bootstrap4 bootcamp by Colt Steele in Udemy and wanted to test my Bootstrap knowledge.
 - As I occasionally play League of Legends, I sometimes check www.op.gg website for my stats etc.
 - This website seemed as if it was built entirely by Bootstrap components and colors, so I thought it would be a nice idea to try to clone it.

# Skills focused
 - I mainly focused on Bootstrap4.
 - Didn't pay attention to CSS BEM notation.
 - Didn't pay attention to SASS folder structure, SASS coding.
 - I tried to code the website entirely using only Bootstrap, with minimal amount of my own CSS code.
 
 # Future plans
 - I think I have enough knowledge with Bootstrap grid system, Bootstrap Flex, and components,
 therefore I will start learning new features of JavaScript and start learning React.js.
